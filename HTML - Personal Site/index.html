        <p><em>Marketer, Designer and Developer Wannabe</em></p>
        <p>
          I grew up travelling with my family overseas, primarily living in the Middle East.
          At 18 I returned to my birth country, New zealand for university. Eventually obtainining a Bachelor of Science
          with a double Major in Statistics and Chemistry. This in 2016. 7 years after starting the degree.
          Many things caused delays, such as leaving medicine as well as dropping out dur to a broken back from flying off a sand dune "cliff."
          Throughout my time studying though I had a major interest in marketing and studied all I could get on it, particular direct response marketing from
          greatest minds in that area such as Halbert, Caples, Carlton, Kennedy (both of them), Schwartz and so on. No doubt it appealed to
          because of how it was determined to quantify results from marketing (being a Stats major this naturally was an interest).
        </P>
        <p>
          Eventually though, as I did some things with it I realized a conflict of interest between us copywriters/marketers and the design teams.
          To remedy this I decided to learn some about design so I could see things from their perspective more. But as is my nature I ended up obsessively diving
          into its depth and learning all the software (Photoshop, illustrator, InDesign), typography, color theory and various design principles from wonderful designers.
          I started to admire design and its potential in marketing - although I always still approach it with a mindset of marketing and not just "does this look nice"
          but rather will this help sales...and will this help my client and is it what they want! Rather than "is this pretty."

        </p>
        <p> Further I was always naturally interested in programming. I spent a lot of time on the computer in my life, primarily reading and used to be a "whiz kid." When I was 12
          a teacher of mine paid me (illegally mind you, as I was not only underage but also in a country where I naturally had no work visa!) to create a website for him.
          I did this during my lunch breaks, instead of going out and playing with friends (mind you by that age we had sadly stopped playing and mostly just hung around talking)
          Of course, computers and HTML were very different then...I don't recall doing any CSS either though it was around. It was a very 90s website. Later when I had contact with him
          he asked if I was working in IT or programming. Surprised I was not. As were many others. But in the end, I did return to what I was naturally inclined to when younger.

          Now I also code. Not well mind you. I feel stupid for having "left it" at some point. But nonetheless it brings me great satisfcation.</p>
